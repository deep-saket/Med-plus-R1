# Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Medical Vision-Language Models

**Med-R1** is a reinforcement learning-enhanced vision-language model (VLM) tailored for generalizable medical reasoning. Built on Qwen2-VL-2B, Med-R1 is trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to support **8 medical imaging modalities** and **5 key diagnostic tasks**, delivering high performance with parameter efficiency.

## 🔍 Overview

Med-R1 explores the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve medical reasoning in vision-language models. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which may overfit to task-specific data, Med-R1 leverages reward-driven optimization to guide reasoning paths that are robust, diverse, and interpretable.
